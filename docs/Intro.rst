Introduction
============

Cluster POWER-Up enables greatly simplified configuration of clusters of
bare metal OpenPOWER servers running Linux and/or installation of software
to clusters of servers. It leverages widely used open
source tools such as Cobbler, Ansible and Python. Because it relies
solely on industry standard protocols such as IPMI and PXE boot, hybrid
clusters of OpenPOWER and x86 nodes can readily be supported. Currently
Cluster POWER-Up supports Ethernet networking. POWER-Up can
configure simple flat networks for typical HPC
environments or more advanced networks with VLANS and bridges for
OpenStack environments. Complex heterogeneous clusters can be easily deployed
using POWER-Up's interface and node templates. POWER-Up configures
the switches in the cluster with support for multiple switch vendors. Software
installation allows for 'pluggable' software install modules which can be user
created. Utilities are provided to facilitate the creation of repositories
and installation of the nginx web server.

Overview
--------

Cluster POWER-Up is designed to be easy to use. If you are implementing
one of the supported architectures with supported hardware, it eliminates
the need for custom scripts or programming. It does this via a text
configuration file (config.yml) which drives the cluster configuration.
The configuration file is a YAML text file which the user edits. Several
example config files are included docs directory. The configuration
process is driven from a "deployer" node which can be removed from the
cluster when finished. The POWER-Up process is as follows;

#. Rack and cable the hardware.
#. Initialize hardware.

   - initialize switches with static IP address, userid and password.
   - insure that all cluster compute nodes are set to obtain a DHCP
     address on their BMC ports and they are configured to support
     PXE boot on one of their network adapters.

#. Install the Cluster POWER-Up software on the deployer node.
#. Edit an existing config.yml file to drive the configuration.
#. Run the POWER-Up software

When finished, Cluster POWER-Up generates a YAML formatted inventory file
with detailed information about your cluster nodes. This file can
be read by operational management software and used to seed
configuration files needed for installing a solution software stack.

Hardware and Architecture Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The POWER-Up software supports clusters of servers
interconnected with Ethernet. The
servers must support IPMI and PXE boot. Multiple racks can
be configured with traditional two tier access-aggregation
networking. POWER-Up configures both a management and
data network. In simple / cost sensitive setups, the management
and data networks can be configured on the same physical switch.
Power-Up can configure VLANs and bonded networks with as many ports
as the hardware supports. Redundant data switches (ie MLAG) are also
supported. (Currently only implemented on Mellanox switches.)

Networking
~~~~~~~~~~

Cluster POWER-Up supports Cisco, Mellanox and Lenovo switches. Not all
functionality is enabled on all switch types. Currently redundant
networking (MLAG) is only implemented on Mellanox switches. Port channel
support is only implemented on Cisco (NX-OS) and Mellanox switches.
POWER-Up can configure any number of node interfaces on cluster nodes.
To facilitate installation of higher level software, interfaces can be
optionally renamed.

Interface templates are used to define network configurations
in the config.yml file. These can be physical ports, bonded ports,
Linux bridges or VLANS. Interface templates can be entered using
Ubuntu or Red Hat network configuration syntax. Once defined, interface
templates can be applied to any node template. Node interfaces can
optionally be configured with static IP addresses. These can be assigned
sequentially or from a list.

Compute Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cluster POWER-Up supports clusters of heterogeneous compute nodes. Users
can define any number of node types by creating templates in a config file.
Node templates can include any network templates defined in the network
templates section. The combination of node templates and network templates
allows great flexibility in building heterogeneous clusters with nodes
dedicated to specific purposes.
